# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns focus on **how objects are created**, rather than
how they are used or structured. They abstract the instantiation process,
making systems more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Patterns Covered
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Key Problems They Solve
- Controlling object creation
- Decoupling client code from concrete implementations
- Managing complex construction logic
- Ensuring consistent object lifecycle management

## When to Use Creational Patterns
- When object creation logic is complex or error-prone
- When the system should be independent of how objects are instantiated
- When different implementations may be required at runtime
- When controlling the number of instances is critical

## Notes
Each pattern is implemented in isolation with:
- Clear intent
- Minimal, focused code
- Emphasis on design trade-offs rather than framework usage

## Singleton Pattern

### Variants
- Lazy Singleton (not thread-safe)
- Thread-safe Singleton using locking
- Thread-safe Lazy<T> (recommended)

## Factory Method Pattern
